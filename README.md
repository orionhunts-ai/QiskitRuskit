# QiskitRustKit - Open Source Qiskit QML with Rust. ⚙️

## Why?
Qiskit migrated to a Rust based framework and I am curious about the combined application. My understanding that Quantum circuits and their computational equivalents can be more effective modelled as Graphs. Finally, to see how combining a number of locations into a Quantum system can perform.

# QC
**Qiskit:** The IBM Framework for Quantum Computing. Up to 10 minutes per month on their machines for free
**QML:** qiskit-machine-learning
**rustworkx:** A Qiskit graph generation library

### Goals:

1. Build the core components to interact with a live model in Rust or Mojo for fast, distributed implemtation
2. Writing a clean cross-platform framework
3. Understand the potential use cases for QML

### This library uses
- Rust based high performance framework, Mojo for exclusively python implementation
- Portkey AI Gateway
- Weights and Biases experiment tracking and sweeps for classical machine learning
- Monitoring:
- Metrics: Grafana or Prometheus
